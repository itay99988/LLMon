    Below is the name, notation, and natural language description of a temporal operator, which is an extension of past-time LTL:
    {0}
    
    We aim to calculate the boolean value of this operator, given a sequence of assignments to the boolean variables, which are the operand/operands of this operator.
    Every set of assignments for all operands is considered a single "event". When a new event arrives, we want to update the truth value of the entire operator based the content of that event and previous information.
    The first received event is considered as the first in the event sequence, and the most recent event is considered as the last in the sequence.
    
    Create four different python codes that calculate the truth value of the operator, once a new event arrives. Each code should be based on a slightly different natural language interpretation of the operator description. 
    Each slightly different interpretation should be a description that people that understand mathematical logic may give for the original operator description.
    Important: The code should update the truth value of the operator in an efficient way, using finite domains variables.
    
    - You may store any additional values that may help to successfully calculate the truth value. These variables should also have finite domains.
    - Number the different codes and clearly explain the interpretation they represent. The explanation should reliably reflect the related code.
    - Any code snippet should be a fenced Python code block, e.g.:

      ```python
      # code here
      ```


  create_rules_code: |-
    {2}
    Update code number {0} is defined to be the primary code.
    In addition, {1}

  create_comp_code: |-
    Generate python code that compares the primary version to all the other versions, based on all the possible traces of length {trace_length}. 
    When you mention a version, do not forget to also mention its number. 
    For each pair, the code should print all the distinguishing traces in the order of the comparisons (start with all the distinguishing traces of the first comparison etc.),
    and for each such trace, print which code version accepts its (final verdict is true) and which one rejects (final verdict is false). 
    
    The first line that the script should print is the version name. When a new comparison begins, write a caption that corresponds the comparison.
    Important: use the following format to display distinguishing sequences: (replace variable_name, boolean values and formula numbers with the actual names and values)
    "Trace: <variable_name> = (True, True, True); <variable_name> = (True, False, True) => Version 1: True, Version 3: False"
    It is important to follow this format exactly.
    If two versions have no distinguishing traces, clearly mention that the two versions are equivalent. Do not use pandas. 
    
    The code should be a fenced Python code block, e.g.:

        ```python
        # code here
        ```
    and it should not include a if __name__ == "__main__" block, but it should be a complete code that can be run as is.

  analyze_comp_output: |-
    Consider the different trace comparisons (primary code vs. other code)
    {traces}

    Analyze these traces, and provide the key differences between the two codes in each comparison. 
    You can think it through, but eventually provide the following information for each comparison that has at least one distinguishing trace:
    - key differences as a short description.
    - what the key difference means for each code (briefly explain).
    - choose one distinguishing trace that supports the key differences and briefly explain.
    
    important: if two versions are equivalent, just mention that the versions are equivalent using the phrase "equivalent versions", and do not write anything else.
    
    When you show your analysis, clearly separate between the different comparisons with hyphens (---..).

  get_op_info_json: |-
    The user chose version number {0} as the correct version for the operator.
    For the mentioned temporal‑operator, create a JSON object with exactly these keys:

    \"op_name\": string, # the operator name, as provided by the user.
    
    \"op_notation\": string, # only the operator letter/word (for example "P")

    \"op_description\": string,  # according to the chosen operator version.
    
    \"is_unary\": boolean,  # True if unary, False otherwise
    
    \"class_name\": string, # the name of the class (explained below)

    \"class_content\": string  # Python class implementing the operator

    The class must define:
    • An __init__ that sets initial auxiliary variables, current verdict and previous verdict.
    • An update(left, right) method that updates and returns the verdict. make sure to actively update the verdict after every new event. 
      Try to preserve the code you generated earlier for this version. this function will have one argument for unary operator and two for binary operators.

    Return ONLY the JSON, no markdown fences.
    

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Specification Translation:
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  spec_translation: |-
    Consider the following set of temporal operators:
    {new_constructs}

    Based on these operators and their symbols, translate the following specification into a formula:
    {nl_spec}

    guidelines:
    - detect the events in the specification, and turn each event into a boolean variable (q1, q2 etc)
    - important: think if the specification is ambiguous or not. specifically, think if there are two or more similar operator that fits the natural language description. if it is ambiguous, provide all the possible translations. if it is not ambiguous, provide the single correct translation.
    - the formula (or formulas) should contain only previously mentioned constructs, the common logical connectives (and, or, not..) and boolean variables.
    - important:when you write a formula, use the following notation for a binary operator: 'q1 BINOP q2' (replace BINOP with the relevant symbol), and the following symbols for the logical connectives: !, &&, ||, ->, <->.
    - you are provided with four simple examples:
    1. natural language: "The robot was at the store at all times."
    temporal formula:  H(q1)
    2. natural language: "Whenever the robot is was at the garage, it is not at home."
    temporal formula:  H(q1 -> !(q2))
    3. natural language: "In the past, the robot was at home."
    temporal formula:  P(q1)
    4. natural language: "the robot was previously at q2, but since then it was always at q1."
    temporal formula: q1 S q2

  

    Your final response should contain a json file with a few keys keys: 
    First key- 'var_mapping' - its value is a string that explains the NL event and their associated boolean variables. 
    Second key - 'is_ambiguous' - its value should be either True or False, depending on whether the specification is ambiguous or not.
    Third key - 'formulas' - its value should be a list of the possible translations (one or more formulas with boolean variables).
