Running *construct differentiation* workflow

Welcome!
 Please provide a new temporalâ€‘operator description (name, notation, naturalâ€‘language semantics) and I will suggest some interpretations for it.

name: weak-since. notation: q1 WS q2. description: q1 has been true since q2 was last true (one step after that). If q2 was never true, then q1 must be true for the entire sequence.
Certainly! Below are four different Python codes, each representing a slightly different interpretation of the "weak-since" (WS) operator based on the given description. Each code efficiently updates the truth value of the operator after each new event.

### Interpretation 1: Strict Interpretation
- **Description**: `q1 WS q2` means `q1` has been true since the last occurrence of `q2`, starting from the step immediately after `q2` was last true. If `q2` was never true, `q1` must be true for the entire sequence.

```python
class WeakSinceStrict:
    def __init__(self):
        self.q2_last_true_index = -1
        self.q1_since_q2 = True

    def update(self, q1, q2, index):
        if q2:
            self.q2_last_true_index = index
            self.q1_since_q2 = True
        elif self.q2_last_true_index != -1:
            self.q1_since_q2 = self.q1_since_q2 and q1
        else:
            self.q1_since_q2 = self.q1_since_q2 and q1

        return self.q1_since_q2

# Example usage:
ws_strict = WeakSinceStrict()
events = [(True, False), (True, True), (True, False), (False, False)]
for i, (q1, q2) in enumerate(events):
    print(ws_strict.update(q1, q2, i))
```

### Interpretation 2: Inclusive Interpretation
- **Description**: `q1 WS q2` means `q1` has been true since the last occurrence of `q2`, including the step where `q2` was last true. If `q2` was never true, `q1` must be true for the entire sequence.

```python
class WeakSinceInclusive:
    def __init__(self):
        self.q2_last_true_index = -1
        self.q1_since_q2 = True

    def update(self, q1, q2, index):
        if q2:
            self.q2_last_true_index = index
            self.q1_since_q2 = q1
        elif self.q2_last_true_index != -1:
            self.q1_since_q2 = self.q1_since_q2 and q1
        else:
            self.q1_since_q2 = self.q1_since_q2 and q1

        return self.q1_since_q2

# Example usage:
ws_inclusive = WeakSinceInclusive()
events = [(True, False), (True, True), (True, False), (False, False)]
for i, (q1, q2) in enumerate(events):
    print(ws_inclusive.update(q1, q2, i))
```

### Interpretation 3: Reset on q2 True
- **Description**: `q1 WS q2` resets the requirement for `q1` to be true whenever `q2` becomes true. If `q2` was never true, `q1` must be true for the entire sequence.

```python
class WeakSinceReset:
    def __init__(self):
        self.q2_last_true_index = -1
        self.q1_since_q2 = True

    def update(self, q1, q2, index):
        if q2:
            self.q2_last_true_index = index
            self.q1_since_q2 = True
        else:
            self.q1_since_q2 = self.q1_since_q2 and q1

        return self.q1_since_q2

# Example usage:
ws_reset = WeakSinceReset()
events = [(True, False), (True, True), (True, False), (False, False)]
for i, (q1, q2) in enumerate(events):
    print(ws_reset.update(q1, q2, i))
```

### Interpretation 4: Persistent q1 Requirement
- **Description**: `q1 WS q2` requires `q1` to be true from the first occurrence of `q2` onward. If `q2` was never true, `q1` must be true for the entire sequence.

```python
class WeakSincePersistent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.q2_first_true_index = None
        self.q1_since_q2 = True

    def update(self, q1, q2, index):
        if q2 and self.q2_first_true_index is None:
            self.q2_first_true_index = index
            self.q1_since_q2 = True
        elif self.q2_first_true_index is not None:
            self.q1_since_q2 = self.q1_since_q2 and q1
        else:
            self.q1_since_q2 = self.q1_since_q2 and q1

        return self.q1_since_q2

# Example usage:
ws_persistent = WeakSincePersistent()
events = [(True, False), (True, True), (True, False), (False, False)]
for i, (q1, q2) in enumerate(events):
    print(ws_persistent.update(q1, q2, i))
```

Each code snippet efficiently updates the truth value of the `q1 WS q2` operator based on the specific interpretation of the operator's description.

Let's analyze the distinguishing traces for each comparison and identify the key differences between the primary code (Version 1) and the other versions (Version 2 and Version 4).

### Comparison: Version 1 vs Version 2

#### Key Differences:
- **Description**: The key difference between Version 1 (WeakSinceStrict) and Version 2 (WeakSinceInclusive) lies in how they handle the truth value of `q1` at the step where `q2` is true. Version 1 requires `q1` to be true starting from the step immediately after `q2` was last true, while Version 2 includes the step where `q2` is true in its evaluation.

#### What This Means:
- **Version 1**: Once `q2` becomes true, Version 1 resets the requirement for `q1` to be true starting from the next step. It does not consider the truth value of `q1` at the step where `q2` is true.
- **Version 2**: Version 2 requires `q1` to be true even at the step where `q2` is true. If `q1` is false at that step, the formula evaluates to false.

#### Supporting Trace:
- **Trace**: `q1 = (T, T, F); q2 = (T, T, T)`
  - **Explanation**: In this trace, `q2` is true at every step. Version 1 evaluates to true because it only checks `q1` starting from the step after `q2` is true, which is always true in this trace. Version 2 evaluates to false because `q1` is false at the last step where `q2` is true, violating its requirement.

### Comparison: Version 1 vs Version 4

#### Key Differences:
- **Description**: The key difference between Version 1 (WeakSinceStrict) and Version 4 (WeakSincePersistent) is how they handle the persistence of `q1` after the first occurrence of `q2`. Version 1 resets the requirement for `q1` after each occurrence of `q2`, while Version 4 requires `q1` to be true from the first occurrence of `q2` onward.

#### What This Means:
- **Version 1**: Resets the requirement for `q1` to be true after each occurrence of `q2`. It only checks `q1` starting from the step immediately after the last occurrence of `q2`.
- **Version 4**: Once `q2` becomes true for the first time, Version 4 requires `q1` to be true for all subsequent steps. If `q1` is false at any step after the first occurrence of `q2`, the formula evaluates to false.

#### Supporting Trace:
- **Trace**: `q1 = (T, T, F); q2 = (T, T, T)`
  - **Explanation**: In this trace, `q2` is true at every step. Version 1 evaluates to true because it only checks `q1` starting from the step after `q2` is true, which is always true in this trace. Version 4 evaluates to false because `q1` is false at the last step, violating its requirement for `q1` to be true from the first occurrence of `q2` onward.

These analyses highlight the fundamental differences in how each version interprets the "weak-since" operator, particularly in terms of when and how the truth value of `q1` is evaluated relative to occurrences of `q2`.
