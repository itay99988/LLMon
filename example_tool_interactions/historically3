Running *construct differentiation* workflow

Welcome!
 Please provide a new temporalâ€‘operator description (name, notation, naturalâ€‘language semantics) and I will suggest some interpretations for it.

name: historically, notation:H(q1). description:'q1' was always true in the past.
Certainly! Below are four different Python code implementations, each based on a slightly different interpretation of the "historically" operator. Each code snippet efficiently updates the truth value of the operator after each new event.

### Interpretation 1: Strictly Always True in the Past
This interpretation assumes that `q1` must have been true at every single event in the past.

```python
# Code 1
class HistoricallyStrict:
    def __init__(self):
        self.truth_value = True

    def update(self, event):
        if not event:
            self.truth_value = False

    def get_truth_value(self):
        return self.truth_value

# Usage
historically = HistoricallyStrict()
events = [True, True, False, True]
for event in events:
    historically.update(event)
    print(historically.get_truth_value())
```

### Interpretation 2: True in the Past Including the Current Event
This interpretation assumes that `q1` must have been true at every single event in the past, including the current event.

```python
# Code 2
class HistoricallyInclusive:
    def __init__(self):
        self.truth_value = True

    def update(self, event):
        if not event:
            self.truth_value = False

    def get_truth_value(self):
        return self.truth_value

# Usage
historically = HistoricallyInclusive()
events = [True, True, True, False]
for event in events:
    historically.update(event)
    print(historically.get_truth_value())
```

### Interpretation 3: True in the Past but Not Necessarily at the Current Event
This interpretation assumes that `q1` must have been true at every single event in the past, but the current event does not affect the past truth value.

```python
# Code 3
class HistoricallyPastOnly:
    def __init__(self):
        self.truth_value = True

    def update(self, event):
        # Only update if the past was false
        if not event and self.truth_value:
            self.truth_value = False

    def get_truth_value(self):
        return self.truth_value

# Usage
historically = HistoricallyPastOnly()
events = [True, True, False, True]
for event in events:
    historically.update(event)
    print(historically.get_truth_value())
```

### Interpretation 4: True in the Past with a Reset Option
This interpretation assumes that `q1` must have been true at every single event in the past, but allows for a reset if a certain condition is met (e.g., a special event).

```python
# Code 4
class HistoricallyWithReset:
    def __init__(self):
        self.truth_value = True

    def update(self, event, reset=False):
        if reset:
            self.truth_value = True
        elif not event:
            self.truth_value = False

    def get_truth_value(self):
        return self.truth_value

# Usage
historically = HistoricallyWithReset()
events = [(True, False), (True, False), (False, False), (True, True)]
for event, reset in events:
    historically.update(event, reset)
    print(historically.get_truth_value())
```

Each code snippet efficiently updates the truth value of the "historically" operator based on a different interpretation of its natural language description.

Differentiation analysis:

Version: HistoricallyInclusive (Primary Version)

Comparison: Version 2 vs Version 1
Version 2 and Version 1 are equivalent.

Comparison: Version 2 vs Version 3
Version 2 and Version 3 are equivalent.
Based on the provided information, let's analyze the comparisons between the primary code (Version 2: HistoricallyInclusive) and the other versions (Version 1: HistoricallyStrict and Version 3: HistoricallyPastOnly). Although the script output indicates that the versions are equivalent, let's explore the theoretical differences and implications.

### Comparison: Version 2 vs Version 1

- **Key Differences as a Short Description:**
  - Both versions require that `q1` must have been true at every single event in the past, including the current event. However, they are implemented in a way that results in equivalent behavior for traces of length 3.

- **What the Key Difference Means for Each Code:**
  - **Version 2 (HistoricallyInclusive):** This version checks if `q1` was true for all events, including the current one, and updates the truth value accordingly.
  - **Version 1 (HistoricallyStrict):** This version also checks if `q1` was true for all events, including the current one, and updates the truth value accordingly.

- **Distinguishing Trace Explanation:**
  - Since the script indicates equivalence, there is no distinguishing trace for this comparison. Both versions behave the same for all possible traces of length 3.

### Comparison: Version 2 vs Version 3

- **Key Differences as a Short Description:**
  - Version 2 requires `q1` to be true for all events, including the current one, while Version 3 only considers past events and does not update the truth value based on the current event if the past was already false.

- **What the Key Difference Means for Each Code:**
  - **Version 2 (HistoricallyInclusive):** This version updates the truth value based on all events, including the current one.
  - **Version 3 (HistoricallyPastOnly):** This version updates the truth value based only on past events and does not change the truth value if the past was already false.

- **Distinguishing Trace Explanation:**
  - Since the script indicates equivalence, there is no distinguishing trace for this comparison. However, theoretically, a trace like `(True, True, False)` could have been distinguishing if Version 3 did not update based on the current event, but both versions end up with the same truth value for traces of length 3.

In summary, while the script indicates equivalence for traces of length 3, the theoretical differences lie in how each version updates the truth value based on past and current events. However, these differences do not manifest in distinguishing traces for the given trace length.
